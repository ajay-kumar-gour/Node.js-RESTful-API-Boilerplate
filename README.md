# Node.js RESTful API Boilerplate

This repository serves as a starting point for building a Node.js RESTful API using Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Project Structure

The project follows a common structure for organizing Node.js applications. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- **app.js**: Entry point of the application where the Express server is configured and started.
- **src/**: Directory containing the source code of the application.
  - **config/**: Configuration files such as database connection settings, environment variables, and JWT secret key.
  - **controllers/**: Controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing data, and sending responses.
  - **middlewares/**: Custom middleware functions for handling authentication, error handling, request logging, etc.
  - **models/**: Mongoose models representing database schemas and interacting with MongoDB.
  - **routes/**: Route definitions specifying the API endpoints and their corresponding controller methods.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions used throughout the application.
  - **services/**: Business logic services encapsulating reusable business logic.
  - **constants/**: Constants files containing static values used across the application.
- **node_modules/**: Directory containing project dependencies installed via npm or yarn.
- **package.json**: Metadata file containing project information and dependencies.
- **package-lock.json**: Automatically generated file ensuring consistent installation of dependencies across different environments.
- **.gitignore**: File specifying intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for setup and usage.
